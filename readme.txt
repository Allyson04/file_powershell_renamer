A minor script to learn a few functions with Powershell. 
It renames any file (not folders) from where it is run, only changing the filename, so the extension is preserved.

Steps of:
1. Opens the file, so you can know the content inside it;
2. Asks the new filename for it;
3. Asks confirmation for the renaming;
4. Repeats steps 1 to 3 until there's no other file remaining.
